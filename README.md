<h1 align="center">Hello WorldðŸ‘‹, I'm Preetam Pati</h1>
<h3 align="center">Kolkata, India</h3>

<p>Greetings, fellow humans! Iâ€™m a CSE student with a flair for deep learning and NLP. I have ventured into reinforcement learning in fantastical realms like MR and VR, and fine-tuned amazing models like BERT, LLAMA, GPT, and IRL GANs. Iâ€™m always hungry to learn new things and solve wicked problems. Behold my projects, they are out of this world! And if you share my appetite, donâ€™t be shy, letâ€™s unite. We can cook some recipes together that can make the world much better. </p>
